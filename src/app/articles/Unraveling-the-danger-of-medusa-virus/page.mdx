2. **Key Exchange**: Implements RSA-4096 for secure key transmission to the command and control servers
3. **File Targeting**: Prioritizes valuable file types (.docx, .xlsx, .db, .backup, .vhd, .vmdk, etc.)
4. **Shadow Copy Deletion**: Removes all Windows shadow copies to prevent easy recovery
5. **Extension Renaming**: Changes file extensions to ".medusa" after encryption
6. **Staged Encryption**: Encrypts files in stages to avoid detection by monitoring tools

```python
# Pseudocode representation of Medusa's encryption process
def medusa_encrypt(file):
    # Generate a unique AES key for this file
    aes_key = generate_random_aes_key()
    
    # Read file data
    file_data = read_file(file)
    
    # Encrypt the file content
    encrypted_data = aes_encrypt(file_data, aes_key)
    
    # Retrieve attacker's public key embedded in ransomware
    rsa_public_key = load_rsa_public_key()
    
    # Encrypt the AES key with the RSA public key
    encrypted_aes_key = rsa_encrypt(aes_key, rsa_public_key)
    
    # Write the encrypted data and key to the file
    write_encrypted_file(file + ".medusa", encrypted_data, encrypted_aes_key)
    
    # Securely delete the original file
    secure_delete(file)
```
